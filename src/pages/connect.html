                in the wrong spot and are looking for more information about me in the workplace, check out my 'me' (above) or 'about' (below) section.

                    <p> So... a bit about me. I was actually born in India, and was adopted by an American family - my parents were both
                        computer engineers but until recently, I actually had no idea what that entailed. I just knew they were <i>very</i> smart.
                        My dad had an IBM Thinkpad in the 90s which was pretty high tech for the early days and I absolutely loved how fast the 
                        mouse would move if I vigorously held the little red button in the middle of the keyboard.
                    </p>
                </span>
                <span class="middle">
                    <p>
                        Anyways, fast-forward to now and I'm always the one in the group who can press a few keys/buttons on anything electronic
                    and voilà - the item is working again! I always liked computers and their advanced capabilities so I think it's fitting
                    that I've taken the route in synthesizing design and computers, in whatever way that may be. I have a passion for clean and minimum 
                    design when I create which is probably also a testament to my lifestyle. I also enjoy challenging thought-processes and logic,
                    which may have come from my general childhood.

                    Since moving to Australia from Washington D.C. (USA), I've been lucky enough to gain a greater appreciation for the general 
                    outdoors. I enjoy spending time in the sun and near the ocean. I try to live a mindful and purposeful daily life, with balance 
                    and energy. I spend a lot of time doing pilates and riding horses (when I can)! My husband and I also love to travel and experiencing
                    new places. A fun fact about me - I've gone cage-floor diving with great white sharks off the coast of South Australia!
